A PEG parser generator built for [Marzipan](https://github.com/cmounce/marzipan).

Currently tightly coupled to Marzipan's specific needs and not designed for general use.
It might evolve into a standalone library in the future if there's broader interest.
But until then, you probably want something like [pest](https://pest.rs/) if you're looking for a PEG parser.
